## Task 0.1
I have many achievements I'm very proud of, one of them was a Project I made to apply for a scholarship at UDK in 2017, where I presented my project in a Website, doing a Snapchat Treasure Hunt, where I've had Mentors that via snapvideos guided me through the Hunt and gave me the next tool to go on.

## Task 0.2
More than an Article, I've been making an Analysis of the Instagram Algorithm, and how nowadays is no more profitable for someone willing to become an Influencer to use Instagram as fan base, cause now that there are too many of them, they are basing all on the money, which makes me also thinks that we are becoming less and less free in our Social Media World.
